## Overview 
This was a Frontend Mentor Challenge which allowed me to practice designing different layouts for the different screen sizes. I had a lot of fun in the process, and I hope my code helps the next person. Happy coding!!!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process 
I started by using Figma to assist me with the styling while trying to make sure that I lined everything up as close to the photo as possible. Afterwards, I began building it and designing from the small screen size first and then to the large. The last few steps were adding the JavaScript and the extra fun add on things to learn a little more things along the way. I wanted to help anyone else who looks at the code by adding notes that include the sites I looked at to help me. 


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com)
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) - To help with the styles


### What I learned 

During this challenge, I was able to practice designing different layouts with the different breaking points. I also learned more about JavaScript.

### Continued development 

My goal is to continue to do projects to better my skills and learn more about JavaScript and React/React Native.

### Useful resources
Alot of the more specific resources that I used are listed throughout the code, but below is a brief overview.

- [w3school.com](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for with finding the average of a number while using javaScript. 
- [Bootstrap 5](https://www.bootstrap.com) - This is an amazing site which helped me better understand the breaking points and how to make elements appear and disappear on different breaking points.
